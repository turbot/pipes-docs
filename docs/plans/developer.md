# Developer Plan

The **Developer Plan** provides essential features for individual users.  

With the developer plan, you get a [developer account](/pipes/docs/developer-account) that allows you to create [connections](/pipes/docs/schemas) and [workspaces](/pipes/docs/workspaces) for your personal use.

You can get started for free - No credit card required! The plan includes 400 compute minutes and 3GB storage, but you can [purchase additional capacity](/pipes/pricing) in a monthly pay-as-you-go model.

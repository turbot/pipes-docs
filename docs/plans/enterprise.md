# Enterprise Plan

The **Enterprise Plan** provides organization-wide security, compliance, and scalability.

With the enterprise plan, you can create your own isolated [Tenant](/pipes/docs/tenants), with a custom domain for your environment.  Your tenant has its own discrete set of user accounts, [organization](/pipes/docs/organizations), and [workspaces](/pipes/docs/workspaces), giving you centralized visibility and control.  You can choose which [authentication methods](/pipes/docs/tenants/settings#authentication-methods) are allowed, configure which [domains to trust](/pipes/docs/tenants/settings#trusted-login-domains), and set up [SAML](/pipes/docs/tenants/settings#saml) to integrate your Pipes tenant with your single-sign-on solution. 

The enterprise plan includes 3 users, 10,000 compute minutes, and 100GB storage capacity, but you can [purchase additional capacity](/pipes/pricing) in a monthly pay-as-you-go model.

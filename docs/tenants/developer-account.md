# Developer Account

Each member of a tenant has their own [developer account](/pipes/docs/developer-account).  The developer account allows users to create workspaces for personal use, but these workspaces cannot be shared.  Unlike [organizations](/pipes/docs/tenants/organizations), developer accounts cannot contain any members other than the owner.

The storage and compute resources used by developer accounts in your tenant are included in the billable usage for your tenant.

# Organizations

Users of your tenant can create their own connections and workspaces in their [developer account](/pipes/docs/tenants/developer-account), but they are
not shared with other users. [Organizations](/pipes/docs/organizations), on the other hand, enable you to collaborate and share workspaces and connections with other members of your tenant.

The storage and compute resources used by organizations in your tenant are included in the billable usage for your tenant.

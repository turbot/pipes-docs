# Organizations

Turbot Pipes users can create their own connections and workspace, but they are
not shared with other users. Steampipe **Organizations**, on the other hand,
include multiple users and are intended for organizations to collaborate and
share workspaces and connections. 

Organizations are available on the [Team](/pipes/docs/plans/team) and [Enterprise](/pipes/docs/plans/enterprise) plans.

## Creating Organizations

To create an organization, select the double arrow button from the navigation at
the top of the page, and select **Create Organization** from the menu. Select a
unique handle for your organization. This handle must be a unique name across
all developer accounts and organizations. Optionally, expand the **Profile** and set
a **Logo URL** (publicly accessible URL for the organization's logo) and **URL**
(publicly accessible URL for the organization). Click **Create Organization**.

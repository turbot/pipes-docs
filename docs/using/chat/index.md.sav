# Chat

Turbot Pipes includes an integrated AI chat assistant that helps you query, analyze, and understand your cloud infrastructure data. The AI chat feature provides intelligent assistance for running Steampipe queries, generating reports, and exploring your connected resources.

You can ask questions about your infrastructure in natural language, and the AI agent will automatically translate them into appropriate Steampipe queries. For example:
- "How many EC2 instances do I have in each region?"
- "List my storage buckets"
- "Analyze my storage buckets for security issues"
- "Write a Python script to identify storage buckets with public access"

## Using Chat

You can access the AI chat assistant from any workspace in Turbot Pipes. Navigate to your workspace and click on the **Chat** tab to open the interactive chat interface.

The chat interface displays your conversation history on the left sidebar and the main chat area on the right, where you can interact with the AI assistant.

### Having a Conversation

To start a new conversation, type your prompt in the test box, select a model, and then click the green arrow button or hit the **Enter** key. The screen will update as the model is thinking and working on a response.

When its done thinking, the results are displayed.

If you want, you can continue the asking questions and the context will be maintained for the duration of the conversation.

### Selecting a Model 

If you have configured an AI API key, you may use the model selector at the bottom right of the text box to choose which AI model to use for your conversation. Note that you cannot change the model once you have started the conversation.

Pipes includes a small amount of monthly AI usage for each user. This free tier is limited to the GPT-5 Mini model.  You may instead configure Pipes to use your own OpenAI or Anthropic API key.  Where to configure the key depends on your [plan](https://turbot.com/pipes/pricing):
  - Enterprise customers may [configure their keys on their tenant]().
  - Team plan customers may [configure their keys on their organization]().
  - Developer tier users may [configure their keys on their personal developer account]().
  

### Interacting with the Canvas

Some responses will include structured artifacts like tables, code, or markdown documents.  These artifacts may appear in the main response or the thinking.  Click the **View** button next to the artifact to view it in a canvas.

The canvas will open on the right side of the screen.  The exact view will depend on the type of artifact, as will the buttons and actions available.  The grid view, for instance, allows you to view the SQL that was used to generate the results.

Click the **Copy** button to copy or download the results or the query.

Hovering over a table header will provide a popup menu that allows you to copy, filter, download, or view details of the results.

Hovering over a table call will provide a popup menu that allows you to copy, filter, exclude, or view details of the cell.

### Viewing Detailed Thinking

Every time you send a new prompt in the conversation, the AI agent will perform thinking steps.  By default, the visibility of the thinking is minimized.  You can, however, view the full details of the thinking.  To view the thinking for a give step, click the node in the chat stream to expand it; it will say **Thinking** will it is in progress, or **Thought for {duration}** once it is complete.

### Intelligent Query Generation
When you ask infrastructure-related questions, the AI assistant will:
1. **Find Steampipe connections** - Automatically discover available connections in your workspace
2. **Identify relevant tables** - Locate the appropriate tables and columns for your query
3. **Generate SQL queries** - Create optimized Steampipe queries to answer your question
4. **Execute and present results** - Run the query and format the results in an easy-to-read table

### Integration with Steampipe Tools
The AI chat seamlessly integrates with your existing Steampipe infrastructure:
- **Steampipe**: Query your cloud with SQL
- **Powerpipe**: Benchmarks & dashboards  
- **Flowpipe**: Workflow for DevOps

## Chat History

Your chat conversations are automatically saved and organized in the sidebar. The conversation title is automatically generated based on the chat contents. 

Click any conversation to continue where you left off.

You can delete or change the title for a conversation from the popup menu. Hover over the chat you wish to modify or delete, then click the context button (3 vertical dots) to show the popup menu.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Be specific** - Include details about what you want to analyze or accomplish
- **Ask follow-up questions** - The AI maintains conversation context for deeper exploration  
- **Request different formats** - Ask for reports, scripts, or specific analysis approaches
- **Combine topics** - Ask questions that span multiple AWS services or cloud providers

The AI chat feature makes it easy to explore and understand your cloud infrastructure without needing to write complex SQL queries manually.

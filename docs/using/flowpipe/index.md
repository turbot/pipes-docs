# Flowpipe

Your workspace includes a hosted [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io) instance.  Flowpipe is a workflow-as-code tool that enables you to automate cloud operations. 

After you install mods into your workspace, their pipelines will be available to run.  You can run them on demand or set up triggers to run them automatically on a schedule or in response to events.

Once your workspace has been created, your Flowpipe server is automatically available. Your Flowpipe pipelines can connect to your Steampipe instance, and all the connections in your workspace are available to your Flowpipe pipelines.

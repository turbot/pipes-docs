# Executions

The  **Executions** tab provides visibility into the Flowpipe pipeline and triggers executions.  You can view the status of running and completed processes and view their logs.

To view your activity, navigate to your workspace.  From the **Pipes** tab, select **Flowpipe**, then go to the **Executions** tab.

You can filter the list of processes using a query filter.  Click the **Query** dropdown to select a pre-defined filter, or enter your own using the [Pipes query filter syntax](/pipes/docs/reference/query-filter#syntax).

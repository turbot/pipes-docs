# Dashboards

Once you've added a connection and installed one or more mods into your
workspace, the [Dashboards](https://powerpipe.io/docs/run/dashboard) and
[Benchmarks](https://powerpipe.io/docs/run/benchmark) will become available for you to run in the
**Dashboards** tab. You can browse the list, or use the powerful search to
filter by name / tag etc.

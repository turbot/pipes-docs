# Powerpipe

Your workspace includes a hosted [Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io) server.  Powerpipe enables you to visualize your data with dashboards and assess security posture with a massive library of benchmarks.

Once your workspace has been created, your Powerpipe server will automatically be available.  The dashboard server is secured as well; only members of your workspace can view and run dashboards and reports.  Your Powerpipe instance can connect to your Steampipe instance automatically; create and attach connections to Steampipe, then install Powerpipe mods to make their dashboards and benchmarks available.

You can take snapshots of your dashboards and benchmarks and share them with others.  By default, snapshots are only visible to members of your workspace, but you can create them with public links if you prefer.  You can schedule the snapshots to run, automating the creation and publishing of your reports.

# Connections

A **[Connection](/pipes/docs/connections)** represents a set of tables for a **single data source**.  In order to query data, you'll need at least one connection to provide credentials and other configuration information.

Developer accounts are limited to workspace-level connections and folders, which may only be used within the workspace in which they are defined; they cannot be shared. You can [manage your workspace's connections](/pipes/docs/connections#managing-connections) from the **Advanced** tab for your workspace.  Navigate to your workspace, go to the **Advanced** tab, then click **Connections** from the menu on the left to see a list of the connections that are currently available to the workspace.

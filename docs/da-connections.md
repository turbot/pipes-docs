# Connections

A **[Connection](/pipes/docs/connections)** represents a set of tables for a **single data source**.  In order to query data, you'll need at least one connection to provide credentials and other configuration information.

You can define connections for your developer account and then attach them to any workspace in the account - they can be shared by multiple workspaces within the account.

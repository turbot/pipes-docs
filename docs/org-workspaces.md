# Workspaces

Your organization may contain one or more **[Workspaces](/pipes/docs/workspaces)** . A workspace comprises a single Steampipe database instance
as well as a directory of mod resources such as queries, benchmarks, and
controls. Workspaces allow you to separate your Steampipe instances for
security, operational, or organizational purposes.  

Workspaces created in an organization may be shared with other member of the organization.  You must be assigned the organization **Owner** role to create workspaces or set workspaces permissions.

# Developer Account

When you sign up for Turbot Pipes, a developer account is created for you.  Your developer account allows you to create workspaces for your personal use, but these workspaces cannot be shared.  Unlike [organizations](/pipes/docs/organizations), developer accounts cannot contain any members other than the owner.

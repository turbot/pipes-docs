# Using Pipes

Turbot Pipes is the only intelligence, automation & security platform built specifically for DevOps.  Its easy to [get started](/pipes/docs/)!  

Once you have created a [workspace](/pipes/docs/workspaces) and added some [connections](/pipes/docs/connections), you can query your data from the online [interactive query console](/pipes/docs/queries) or [connect](/pipes/docs/connect) to your workspaces with any Postgres-compatible application.   Install [mods](/pipes/docs/mods) to visualize your data with [dashboards](/pipes/docs/dashboards).  Create [snapshots](/pipes/docs/dashboards#saving--sharing-snapshots) and share them with others on-demand or on a [schedule](/pipes/docs/dashboards#scheduling-snapshots).

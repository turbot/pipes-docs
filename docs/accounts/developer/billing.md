# Billing

The **Billing** page provides visibility into the current state of billing for your developer account. 

For developers, this will always be free (subject to plan inclusions) with the option to upgrade to a [paid plan](#developers) to unlock additional usage.

To manage billing, go to the **Advanced** page for your developer account and click **Billing** from the left-hand menu.  The billing page will not be available if your developer account is part of a [tenant](/pipes/docs/accounts/tenant).

## Developers

For developers, you have the option to upgrade to a paid plan. This will allow you to unlock additional usage, which you will be billed for in arrears on a monthly basis. For more information, please see our [pricing FAQs](/pipes/pricing).

To upgrade to a paid plan, first [add a payment card](#debit--credit-card-payment), then click the **Create Subscription** button. You are free to cancel this at any stage by clicking the **Cancel Subscription** button, which will produce a final invoice for the subscription and return you back to the included usage limits.


## Debit / Credit Card Payment

If you wish to upgrade to a paid plan, you must first enter your card details. To do so, click the **Add Card** button.

This will create a secure connection between your browser and our payment provider. **Please note**: We *never* store your card details on our servers.

At the top of the page, you will see a summary of your billing information:

- The billing [plan](/pipes/pricing) for this account.
- The dates of the current billing cycle.  Billing cycles vary by account and may not coincide with a calendar month.
- The amount of the last invoice, along with its payment status
- The amount of the next invoice

### Invoices

The invoices table provides a list of previous invoices, including the invoice date, the amount, and the payment status. You can download any of these invoices by clicking the options menu (three vertical dots) at the end of the line and selecting **Download** from the popup menu.

### Cards

The cards section lists your active debit/credit cards. One of these cards must be selected as the **default**. The default card is the card that will be billed when subscribed via debit/credit card. Only a non-default card can be removed.

### Manage Subscription

You can cancel the subscription by clicking the **Cancel Subscription** button. The cancellation will occur at the end of the free trial or the current billing period. Once canceled, all your workspaces will be suspended.

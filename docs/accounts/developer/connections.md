# Connections

[Connections](/docs/workspaces/connections) provide the credentials, scope, and configuration information for interacting with an external system.  In order to query data, you'll need at least one connection to provide credentials and other configuration information.

Developer accounts are limited to workspace-level connections and folders, which may only be used within the workspace in which they are defined; they cannot be shared. You can [manage your workspace's connections](/pipes/docs/workspaces/connections#managing-workspace-connections) from the **Connections** tab for your workspace.  Navigate to your workspace, then click **Connections** to see a list of the connections that are currently available to the workspace.

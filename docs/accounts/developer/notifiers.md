# Notifiers

[Notifiers](/pipes/docs/workspaces/notifiers) allow you to define a list of  [integrations](/pipes/docs/integrations/) to send notifications to.  Each notifier contains a list of integrations and related settings used to send and receive data to one or more integrations.

Notifiers that are created for a developer account can be used in any workspace in the account.

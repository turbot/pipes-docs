# Workspaces

Your developer account may contain one or more **[Workspaces](/pipes/docs/workspaces)**. A workspace comprises a single Steampipe database instance
as well as a directory of mod resources such as queries, benchmarks, and
controls. Workspaces allow you to separate your Steampipe instances for
security, operational, or organizational purposes.

In your developer account, workspaces cannot be shared. To create shared workspaces, you must create an **[Organization](/pipes/docs/accounts/org)**.

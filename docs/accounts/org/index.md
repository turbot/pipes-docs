# Organizations

Turbot Pipes users can create their own connections and workspace, but they are
not shared with other users. **Organizations**, on the other hand,
include multiple users and are intended for organizations to collaborate and
share workspaces and connections.

Organizations are available on the [Team](#team-plan) and [Enterprise](/pipes/docs/accounts/tenant#enterprise-plan) plans.

## Team Plan

The **Team Plan** provides collaboration features to elevate team productivity and coordination.

With the team plan, you can create an organization to share your [connections](/pipes/docs/accounts/org/connections) and [workspaces](/pipes/docs/workspaces) with other members of your team.

The team plan includes 3 users, 2,000 compute minutes, and 20GB storage capacity, but you can [purchase additional capacity](/pipes/pricing) in a monthly pay-as-you-go model.


## Creating Organizations

To create an organization, select the double arrow button from the navigation at
the top of the page and select **Create Organization** from the menu. Select a
unique handle for your organization. This handle must be a unique name across
all developer accounts and organizations. Optionally, expand the **Profile** and set
a **Logo URL** (publicly accessible URL for the organization's logo) and **URL**
(publicly accessible URL for the organization). Click **Create Organization**.

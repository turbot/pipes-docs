# People

You can add and remove users from the **People** tab on your organization page.
To invite a user to your organization, click **Invite User**. Enter an email
address or the user handle of an existing user, select a role for the user,
and click **Add**:

| Role       | Description 
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Member** | Can be granted permissions in workspaces and see members of the organization. Members are not granted access to any workspaces by default.
| **Owner** | Have full administrative rights to the organization, including complete access to all workspaces, connections, users, groups, and permissions. Owners are essentially superusers in the organization- they have full implicit access to all workspaces, and their access cannot be removed at the workspace level.


**Org Owners** have implicit access to all workspaces in the organization, and you cannot revoke their access at the workspace level.  **Members**, on the other hand, are not granted access to any workspaces by default; you may [grant access to a workspace](/pipes/docs/workspaces/people) from the **People** tab on your workspace after they have been added to your organization.

To revoke access from a user, select the options menu button ('three dots' button) to the
right of the user and click **Remove**.

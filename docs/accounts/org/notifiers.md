# Notifiers

[Notifiers](/pipes/docs/workspaces/notifiers) allow you to define a list of  [integrations](/pipes/docs/integrations/) to which to send notifications.  Each notifier contains a list of integrations and related settings used to send and receive data to one or more integrations.

Notifiers that are created for an organization can be used in any workspace in the organization.

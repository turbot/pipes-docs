# Tenant Members

You can add and remove users from the **People** tab on your **Tenant Settings** page. Select your profile picture at the top right of the Pipes console, and select **Tenant Settings** from the menu.

To invite a user to your organization, click **Invite User**. Enter an email
address or the user handle of an existing user and select a role for the user,
and click **Add**.

Only users that have been invited to the tenant, or have logged in via a [trusted login domain](/pipes/docs/accounts/tenant/authentication#trusted-login-domains) will have access to the tenant.

A user can be invited as either a **Member** or an **Owner**.

## Tenant Roles

| Role     | Description
|----------|------------------------------------------------------
| `Member` |  The user has access to the tenant, but has no implied permissions. Members cannot see tenant settings, invite other tenant members, or create an organization.
| `Owner`  |  The user has full ownership of the tenant and can manage tenant settings and tenant members.  Owners have full control of all organizations in the tenant.

## Inviting Tenant Members

To invite a new tenant member, navigate to **People** from the **Tenant Settings** section. Click **Invite Member**. Enter the email address of the user you wish to invite and select the role you wish to assign them. Click **Invite**.

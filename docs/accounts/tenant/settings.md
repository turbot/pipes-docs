# Tenant Settings

To manage the settings for your tenant, select your profile picture at the top right of the Pipes console, and select **Tenant Settings**. 
This option will only be visible in a custom tenant for which you are a [tenant owner](people#tenant-roles). 


## Authentication

The [Authentication](/pipes/docs/tenants/authentication) section allows you to control which [domains are trusted](/pipes/docs/tenants/authentication#trusted-login-domains), as well as to enable, disable, and configure various [authentication methods](/pipes/docs/tenants/authentication#authentication-methods).


## Usage

The [Usage](/pipes/docs/usage) section allows you to view [usage across your tenant](/pipes/docs/usage#tenant--organization--user-usage) and control [thresholds](/pipes/docs/usage-thresholds) to manage your spending.


## Billing

The [Billing](/pipes/docs/billing) section allows you to view and manage billing settings for your tenant.
